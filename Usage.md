# Usage
The PoSPro app includes two main components:
- **Frontend (Flutter/Dart):** Provides a mobile and web interface for users to interact with the PoS protocol.
- **Backend (Laravel):** Handles validation, user authentication, and blockchain interactions.

More detailed usage guides will be added as the project evolves.
